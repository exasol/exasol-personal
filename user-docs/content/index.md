# Exasol Personal

Exasol Personal gives you a full Exasol database for personal use. Run it locally on macOS, Linux,
or Windows, or deploy it into your own AWS, Azure, Exoscale, or STACKIT account.

The Exasol Launcher (`exasol`) installs and manages the database from the command line. It can
provision infrastructure, start and stop deployments, display connection details, and open SQL or
shell sessions.

These pages describe the product version selected in the version menu. Choose the version that
matches your installed launcher when commands or supported capabilities differ between releases.

## Quick start

To install and run Exasol Personal locally on macOS, Linux, or Windows, follow these steps.

Install the launcher:

```bash
curl https://downloads.exasol.com/exasol-personal/installer.sh | sh
```

The installer places the `exasol` binary in `~/.local/bin`. If that directory is not in `PATH`,
follow the instructions printed by the installer.

Install and start the database:

```bash
exasol install local
```

Connect to your database:

```bash
exasol connect
```

Type any SQL statement terminated by `;`. For example, test your connection with `SELECT 1;`.
See the [Exasol SQL reference](https://docs.exasol.com/db/latest/sql_reference.htm) for the
full syntax.
